# G-Book-Research
This repo is made to collect as much as possible about the first G-Book version that is implemented in different cars

## Introduction
Hi, I just bought a Cypha and the G-Book really interested me since it's almost like I'm driving a 2002 tesla with all the features it has. To further inform people about it I made this repo. In here you can also find some specific tips on installing old medium for Windows XP executables and other fun info about the car

## Note
I gathered all the executables from the internet archive and I will only use it
for locality and ease of use. Wherever you want to download a file the original
page is linked. This means you do not need to download it from here if you do
not trust it.

## General Requests
This library is as active as I can be with a full time job. So please if there is information you found that is not in here, contact me or add the info later.

There are some things I am personally really curious about and I do not have information about. So if you have it again please contact me.

Most Wanted:
- A karaoke file. I'm searching for a karaoke file so I can see how to remake these and what format the Will Cypha supports
- Any translated files, due to my lack of Japanese language and translate being quite slow. Translated files will really boost my productivity in this library.
- Games. Some SD cards have bought games on them and I would like to have the whole collection to really see what the capability is of the Cypha. So If you have some please share them to the community.
