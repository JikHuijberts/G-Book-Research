# General Maps info.
The current system of maps is maps on demand. These were commonly updated with the gbook internet system. Since that is not possible anymore you can use the installer and the mapondemand softare to download the map you want and isntall it.


I am not far enough into the manuals to really explain how it works but according to the recent g-book.com website you can install it into the SD-Card.
