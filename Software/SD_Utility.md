# SD_UTILITY
This is the best way I found to install a new installation of the g-book software on an SD card 

DISCLAIMER!!!!
USE THIS TOOL ONLY WITH CAREFUL CONSIDERATION. This tool is quite unforgiving with bad keypresses. So there is a good possibility that you can wipe your G-Book installed chip.

# Installation
Just use the SD_Utility.exe within the repository or you can find it on the internet archive. [Here](//TODO link).

Follow the installation on a windows XP machine or another windows system. It should work consistently on any windows platform in between.

There will be a windows security warning when trying to install but to install it you need to comply. If you dont feel good about it, again use a virtual machine to run this on. Just remember to save the files backed-up or changed somewhere safe.

## Experiments
Here are some experiments I conducted on the utility tool. If there is something new
### Failed
What I first tried is the top left option of the application. First I backed up the files using the bottom button. It does a lot of stuff but I'm not sure it actually backups the data.

Then I moved all the files from the sd to my computer. Switched the SD-card to an empty one FAT formatted, and written the data over with the second button of the system.
This did not work.

The second test I did with a working SD-card is to port over the games onto the system. Although they are there on the g-book file system. I cannot seem to click SDPlay to play the games. I will further look into this when I have the time.

### Success
The experiment that DID work was the bottom left action called "all files". I used an empty SD card FAT formatted and installed the base file that was already in the application onto the SD Card. When I pushed it into the G-book it worked! The SD card was 2gb and im not sure if the card holder can recognize bigger cards. Next week I will perform more comprehensive tests.
