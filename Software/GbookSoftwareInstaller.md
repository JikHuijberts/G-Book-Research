# Software Installer
There is a lot of information about the software installer. The source of the installation steps can be downloaded in the sources below.
## Functionality
With my current research I could find a lot of different things that could be changed.
Such as:
- Installing new maps using map on demand
- Connect with G-book software to install bought items (outdated since 2022)
- Further installation of software such as Karaoke songs, films, songs and games.

// This page is a very big todo still since I need to manually translate and set everything.


## Installation
The installation process is quite hard, compared to normal .exe installations.

The way I managed it:
Install a virtual machine with windowsXP installed. (also install a japanese language pack to safe you some headaches later on).


Go to the Internet Archive and install the GBook Software Installer. //TODO add link.

When installing you will encounter one main error with an .msi file.
