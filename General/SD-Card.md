# SD Card


## General advice
PLEASE, make a backup of your current SD Card when you are messing with it. Use
a tool that can make an ISO-type file or and img to make a precise copy of the
SD. The tool I personally use is Win32DiskImager.

The file system is quite messy. So when installing new media, you should check
all the folders out to maintain a proper structure.

## Type of SD
Currently I do not have an External SD working on the GBook. One reason that
could be the problem is the sizes of SD I used. Old systems sometimes cannot
tolerate newer SD versions (e.g. bigger than 2GB). I currently ordered new (old)
SD Cards that have the classic SD format to check if it will work.

## Use new SD
// TODO There is no way yet that I found to make a clean new sd card with the
G-Book software implemented. To keep it simple I will make an .img file that has
the most general (but complete with additions) OS on it.

## Missing SD and creating a new one from scratch
When you have a new Cypha without an SD-Card you are quite limited of using a
G-Book. I will make an image of my GBook SD whenever I have the time and copying
methods ready.
